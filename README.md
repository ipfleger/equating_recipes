# equating_recipes
The open source EquatingRecipes software from Brennan et al https://education.uiowa.edu/casma/computer-programs. I'm attempting to be lazy and have an AI convert this to C++ so that I can call it from R or python easier.

I'm required by the license to say that this has absolutely no warranty. Here is a note from the original README:
